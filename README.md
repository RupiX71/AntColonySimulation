# 🐜 AntColonySimulation

A **C++ simulation** of ant colony behavior designed to explore emergent intelligence, colony dynamics, and learning-based approaches to solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.  
Built with **SFML 2.6.2**, this project provides a visual and interactive environment to observe artificial ants learning and adapting within a simulated world.

## 🧠 Introduction

**AntColonySimulation** models the cooperative behavior of ants and their ability to collectively solve optimization problems.  
The simulator demonstrates how individual agents following simple behavioral rules—pheromone trail following, exploration, and communication—can converge toward efficient solutions for complex problems such as the **Traveling Salesman Problem**.

The project serves both as:
- A **biological simulation sandbox** showcasing emergent intelligence, and  
- A **learning experiment** for exploring optimization and AI-inspired techniques in C++.
